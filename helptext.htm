    ~Edit~
    <br>
    Edit or create new fragments:
    <br>
    *Change Picture:* 
    Select a picture for the fragment. Use at least 600dpi pictures.
    <br>
    *Drawstyle:* 
    Save a style file for chemdraw to draw molecular pictures that look
    exactly like the predefined.
    <br>
    *Name:* 
    Name of the fragment
    <br>
    *Unit cell:* 
    Cell parameters of the structure, where the fragment comes from. 
    Use 1 1 1 90 90 90 for cartesian coordinates. The cell and coordinates 
    are automatically converted to cartesian during adding to the database.
    <br>
    *Use selected atoms:* 
    Uses the selected atoms for the Atoms field and creates a picture from the 
    fragment.
    <br>
    *Atoms:* 
    insert atoms here like O2  8  1.3984  -0.3778   0.4922. You can also 
    directly copy atoms from SHELX files or copy coordiinates from Avogadro.
    <br>
    *Restraints:* 
    Type any SHELX compatible restraint here (except SAME). Each restraint 
    has to be in a new line. The length of a line is unlimited.
    <br>
    *Residue:* 
    Define the residue class of the fragment (up to four characters, the first has to be a letter). 
    <br>
    *Reference* 
    Define the origin of the fragment.
    <br>
    ~Reference~
    <br>
    The reference field shows the origin of the fragment.
